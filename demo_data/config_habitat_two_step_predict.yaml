# Habitat Analysis Configuration (Two-Step Strategy) - Predict Mode
# This configuration is used for prediction using a pre-trained two-step habitat pipeline.
# Usage: habit get-habitat --config demo_data/config_habitat_two_step_predict.yaml
# Note: All configuration is in YAML file, no command-line mode override needed.

# Run mode and pipeline settings (REQUIRED for predict mode)
run_mode: predict  # train (train a new model) or predict (use a pre-trained model)
pipeline_path: ./results/habitat_two_step/habitat_pipeline.pkl  # Path to trained pipeline for predict mode
# Note: Update this path to point to your actual trained pipeline file.

# Data paths
data_dir: ./file_habitat.yaml  # Path to data configuration file (same format as training)
out_dir: ./results/habitat_two_step/predict  # Output directory for prediction results

# Habitat segmentation settings (minimal required for predict mode)
HabitatsSegmention:
  clustering_mode: two_step

# General settings
processes: 2  # Number of parallel processes
plot_curves: true  # Whether to generate and save plots
save_results_csv: true  # Whether to save results as CSV files
random_state: 42  # Random seed for reproducibility (should match training)
debug: false  # Enable debug mode for detailed logging
