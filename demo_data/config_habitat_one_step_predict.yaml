# Habitat Analysis Configuration (One-Step Strategy) - Predict Mode
# This configuration is used for prediction using a pre-trained one-step habitat analysis pipeline
# Usage: habit get-habitat --config demo_data/config_habitat_one_step_predict.yaml --mode predict

# Run mode and pipeline settings (REQUIRED for predict mode)
run_mode: predict  # train (if you want to train a new model, set to train) or predict (if you want to use a pre-trained model, set to predict)
pipeline_path: ./results/habitat_one_step/train/habitat_pipeline.pkl  # Path to trained pipeline for predict mode (REQUIRED for predict mode)
# Note: Update this path to point to your actual trained pipeline file

# Data paths
data_dir: ./file_habitat.yaml  # Path to data configuration file (same format as training)
out_dir: ./results/habitat_one_step/predict  # Output directory for prediction results

# Feature extraction settings (optional in predict mode, but kept for reference)
# These settings should match the training configuration

# Habitat segmentation settings (optional in predict mode, kept for reference)
# These settings should match the training configuration
