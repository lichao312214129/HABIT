# Configuration file for Model Prediction
# This file is used with: habit model --mode predict --config demo_data/config_predict.yaml
# 
# This configuration allows you to use a pre-trained model to make predictions on new data.
# The model should have been trained using habit model --mode train

# ============================================================================
# REQUIRED FIELDS
# ============================================================================

# Path to the trained model file (e.g., .pkl, .joblib)
# Supports relative paths (resolved relative to this config file)
# Example: ./ml_data/clinical/models/LogisticRegression_final_pipeline.pkl
model_path: ./ml_data/clinical/models/LogisticRegression_final_pipeline.pkl

# Path to the new data file to be predicted (.csv)
# Must contain the features required by the model (same features used during training)
# The file should have the same structure as the training data, but labels are optional
data_path: ./ml_data/clinical_feature.csv

# Directory to save prediction results
# All outputs (predictions, evaluation metrics if evaluate=true) will be saved here
output_dir: ./ml_data/clinical/predictions

# ============================================================================
# OPTIONAL FIELDS
# ============================================================================

# (Optional) Name of the model for logging purposes
# If not specified, will be inferred from model_path
# model_name: MyBestModel

# (Optional) Whether to evaluate performance (requires ground truth labels in data)
# If true, the data must contain a label column (see label_col below)
# Default: false
evaluate: true

# (Optional) Ground truth label column name (required if evaluate=true)
# If not specified, will try to auto-detect from common column names:
# ['label', 'Target', 'class', 'diagnosis', 'outcome', 'y']
# label_col: label

# (Optional) Output column names for predictions
# output_label_col: predicted_label      # Column name for predicted labels
# output_prob_col: predicted_probability  # Column name for predicted probabilities

# (Optional) For multiclass classification: which class index to extract probabilities
# If None, probabilities for all classes will be included
# probability_class_index: null

# (Optional) For binary classification: which index is the positive class
# Default: 1 (meaning class 1 is positive, class 0 is negative)
# binary_positive_class_index: 1
