# Configuration file for Model Prediction
# This file is used with: habit model --mode predict --config demo_data/config_predict.yaml

# Path to the trained model file (e.g., .pkl, .joblib)
# Supports relative paths (resolved relative to this config file)
model_path: ./ml_data/clinical/models/LogisticRegression_final_pipeline.pkl

# Path to the new data file to be predicted (.csv)
# Must contain the features required by the model
data_path: ./ml_data/clinical_feature.csv

# Directory to save prediction results
output_dir: ./ml_data/clinical/predictions

# (Optional) Name of the model for logging purposes
# model_name: MyBestModel

# (Optional) Whether to evaluate performance (requires ground truth labels in data)
# Default: false
evaluate: true
